Assignment Name: R01: SWOT Analysis (inspired by UCSC Experiments video)
Description (cleaned):
For this reading response assignment, we want you to run an opinionated SWOT analysis for Teaching with Generative AI. However, instead of having you immediately launch into generating ideas, we want you to get grounded in concrete examples. When you think about the future of Teaching with Generative AI, we want you to be imagining specific teachers, specific courses, and specific assignments and other activities within those courses.
Begin by watching this 100-minute video of a sequence of short talks presented during the Experiments in AI in Teaching and Learning . All of the presenters in this video are people you might bump into on campus, and they are a good representative of the range of experiments that are already ongoing here. Feel free to watch the video at something other than 1x speed if you are comfortable with doing so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTF_1ENAwVs
After you've watched the video, come back here to Canvas to share your thoughts in the form of a SWOT analysis . In a SWOT analysis, you try to map out a strategic landscape (a space of action policies we might adopt) by spreading it over four categories:
Strengths: What does GenAI seem to be good at or help in relation to teaching?
Weaknesses: Where does GenAI fail or cause harm in relation to teaching (even if somewhat speculative)?
Opportunities: What outside development or action could make GenAI more helpful in teaching (e.g. if solved or implemented)?
Threats: What outside factors could block GenAI from having beneficial impacts or lead to harmful effects?
Strengths and Weaknesses should relate to factors we can control by deciding how to implement GenAI in teaching. Meanwhile, Opportunities and Threats should represent things outside of our control (dependent on the actions of other organizations). These might include development of similar technologies with slightly different properties (e.g. How would the development of "something with the capabilities of ChatGPT but no requirement for GPU-like hardware for inference, capable of running on common smartphones" change the landscape?)
Don’t try to make a fair and accurate list of all S/W/O/T items. Instead, give us your 6 strongest ideas (your spiciest takes) in a way that is roughly spread out over the S/W/O/T categories . Where possible, try to include a clickable hyperlink to an outside source of support for your ideas or claims.

SWOT analysis evaluates the strategic position of organizations and is often used in the preliminary stages of decision-making processes [ 2 ] to identify internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieving goals. Users of a SWOT analysis ask questions to generate answers for each category and identify competitive advantages . SWOT has been described as a "tried-and-true" tool of strategic analysis, [ 3 ] but has also been criticized for limitations such as the static nature of the analysis, the influence of personal biases in identifying key factors, and the overemphasis on external factors, leading to reactive strategies. Consequently, alternative approaches to SWOT have been developed over the years. Overview [ edit ] The name is an acronym for four components: Strengths : characteristics of the business or project that give it an advantage over others Weaknesses : characteristics that place the business or project at a disadvantage relative to others Opportunities : elements in the environment that the business or project could exploit to its advantage Threats : elements in the environment that could cause trouble for the business or project Results of the assessment are often presented in the form of a matrix . [ 4 ] Internal and external factors [ edit ] Strengths and weaknesses are usually considered internal, while opportunities and threats are usually considered external. [ 5 ] The degree to which an organization's internal strengths matches with its external opportunities is known as its strategic fit . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Internal factors may include: [ 9 ] Human resources—staff, volunteers, board members, stakeholders Physical resources—location, building, equipment, plant Financial—revenue, grants, investments, other sources of income Activities and processes—projects, programs, systems Past experiences—reputation, knowledge External factors may include: [ 9 ] Future trends in the organization's field or society at large (e.g. macroeconomics , technological change ) The economy—local, national, or international Funding sources—investors, foundations, donors, legislatures Demographics—changes in the age, race, gender, culture of those in the organization serviceable area Physical environment—growth of location in which organisation is situated, access to location Legislation Local, national, or international events A number of authors advocate assessing external factors before internal factors. [ 5 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Use [ edit ] SWOT analysis has been used at different levels of analysis , including businesses , non-profit organizations , governmental units , and individuals . [ 12 ] It is often used alongside other frameworks, such as PEST , as a basis for the analysis of internal and environmental factors. [ 13 ] SWOT analysis may also be used in pre-crisis planning, preventive crisis management , and viability study recommendation construction. [ 14 ] Strategic planning [ edit ] SWOT analysis can be used to build organizational or personal strategy. Steps necessary to execute strategy-oriented analysis involve identifying internal and external factors, selecting and evaluating the most important factors, and identifying relationships between internal and external features. [ 15 ] For instance, strong relations between strengths and opportunities can suggest good conditions in the company and allow using an aggressive strategy. On the other hand, strong interactions between weaknesses and threats could be analyzed as a warning to use a defensive strategy. [ 16 ] One form of SWOT analysis combines each of the four components with another to examine four distinct strategies: [ 10 ] WT strategy (mini–mini): Faced with external threats and internal weaknesses, how to minimize both weaknesses and threats? WO strategy (mini–maxi): Faced with external opportunities and internal weaknesses, how to minimize weaknesses and maximize opportunities? ST strategy (maxi–mini): Faced with internal strengths and external threats, how to maximize strengths and minimize threats? SO strategy (maxi–maxi): Faced with external opportunities and internal strengths, how to maximize both opportunities and strengths? Matching and converting [ edit ] A SWOT analysis can be used to generate matching and converting strategies. [ 17 ] Matching refers to seeking competitive advantage by matching strengths to opportunities. This strategy ensures that an organization leverages its core competencies, resources, and capabilities to capitalize on favorable market conditions, emerging trends, or unmet customer needs. Conversion refers to  converting weaknesses or threats into strengths or opportunities. An example of a conversion strategy is to buy off a threat through collaboration or merger. [ 17 ] Marketing [ edit ] Main article: Marketing management See also: Marketing mix In competitor analysis , marketers can use SWOT analysis to detail and profile the competitive strengths and weaknesses of each competitor in the market. This process may involve analysing competitors' cost structures, sources of profits, resources and competencies, competitive positioning, product differentiation , degree of vertical integration , historical responses to industry developments, among other factors. Relevant marketing research methods may include: Qualitative marketing research such as focus groups Quantitative marketing research such as statistical surveys Experimental techniques such as test markets Observational techniques such as ethnographic (on-site) observation Marketing managers may also design and oversee various environmental scanning and competitive intelligence processes to help identify trends and inform the company's marketing analysis. SWOT analysis of the market position of a small management consultancy with a specialism in human resource management [ 18 ] Strengths Weaknesses Opportunities Threats Reputation in marketplace Shortage of consultants at operating level rather than partner level Well established position with a well-defined market niche Large consultancies operating at a minor level Expertise at partner level in HRM consultancy Unable to deal with multidisciplinary assignments because of size or lack of ability Identified market for consultancy in areas other than HRM Other small consultancies looking to invade the marketplace In community organizations [ edit ] An example of a SWOT template that includes cells for strategies, not only assessments A simple SWOT template Although the SWOT analysis was originally designed for business and industries, it has been used in non-governmental organisations as a tool for identifying external and internal support to combat internal and external opposition for successful implementation of social services and social change efforts. [ 9 ] Understanding particular communities can come from public forums, listening campaigns, and informational interviews and other data collection. [ 9 ] SWOT analysis provides direction to the next stages of the change process . [ 19 ] It has been used by community organizers and community members to further social justice in the context of social work practice, [ 19 ] and can be applied directly to communities served by a specific nonprofit or community organization. [ 20 ] Limitations and alternatives [ edit ] SWOT analysis is intended as a starting point for discussion and not to, in itself, show managers how to achieve a competitive advantage. [ 21 ] In a highly-cited 1997 critique, "SWOT Analysis: It's Time for a Product Recall", Terry Hill and Roy Westbrook observed that one among many problems of SWOT analysis as often practiced is that "no-one subsequently used the outputs [of SWOT analysis] within the later stages of the strategy". [ 22 ] Hill and Westbrook, among others, also criticized hastily designed SWOT lists. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] Other limitations of SWOT practice include: preoccupation with a single strength, such as cost control, leading to a neglect of weaknesses, such as product quality; [ 21 ] and domination by one or two team members doing the SWOT analysis and devaluing possibly important contributions of other team members. [ 24 ] Many other limitations have been identified. [ 15 ] Business professors have suggested various ways to remedy the common problems and limitations of SWOT analysis while retaining the SWOT framework. [ 12 ] Porter's five forces [ edit ] Main article: Porter's five forces analysis See also: Porter's four corners model Michael Porter developed the five forces framework as an alternative to SWOT analyses, which he found lacking in rigor and over-dependent on individual company circumstances. [ 25 ] SOAR [ edit ] SOAR (strengths, opportunities, aspirations, and results) is an alternative technique inspired by appreciative inquiry . [ 26 ] [ 27 ] SOAR has been criticized as having similar limitations as SWOT, such as "the inability to identify the necessary data". [ 28 ] SVOR [ edit ] In project management, the alternative to SWOT known by the acronym SVOR (Strengths, Vulnerabilities, Opportunities, and Risks) compares the project elements along two axes: internal and external, and positive and negative. [ 29 ] It takes into account the mathematical link that exists between these various elements, considering also the role of infrastructures. The SVOR table provides an intricate understanding of the elements hypothesized to be at play in a given project: [ 29 ] : 9 Forces Internal Mathematical link External Positive Total Forces Total Forces given constraints = Infrastructures / Opportunities Opportunities Mathematical link Vulnerabilities given constraints = 1 / Total Forces constant k Opportunities given constraints = 1 / Risks Negative Vulnerabilities Risks given constraints = k / Vulnerabilities Risks Constraints consist of: calendar of tasks and activities, costs, and norms of quality. The " k " constant varies with each project (for example, it may be valued at 1.3). [ 29 ] : 9 History [ edit ] In 1965, three colleagues at the Long Range Planning Service (LRPS) of Stanford Research Institute —Robert F. Stewart, Otis J. Benepe, and Arnold Mitchell —wrote a technical report titled Formal Planning: The Staff Planner's Role at Start-Up . [ 30 ] The report described how a person in the role of a company's staff planner would gather information from managers assessing operational issues grouped into four components represented by the acronym SOFT: the "satisfactory" in present operations, "opportunities" in future operations, "faults" in present operations, and "threats" to future operations. [ 30 ] Stewart et al. focused on internal operational assessment and divided the four components into present (satisfactory and fault) and future (opportunity and threat), [ 30 ] and not, as would later become common in SWOT analysis, into internal (strengths and weaknesses) and external (opportunities and threats). [ 6 ] Also in 1965, four colleagues at the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration (later the Harvard Business School)—Edmund P. Learned, C. Roland Christensen, Kenneth R. Andrews , and William D. Guth—published the first of many editions of the textbook Business Policy: Text and Cases . [ 6 ] ( Business policy was a term then current for what has come to be called strategic management. [ 31 ] ) The first chapter of the textbook stated, without using the acronym, the four components of SWOT and their division into internal and external appraisal: Deciding what strategy should be is, at least ideally, a rational undertaking. Its principal subactivities include identifying opportunities and threats in the company's environment and attaching some estimate of risk to the discernible alternatives. Before a choice can be made, the company's strengths and weaknesses must be appraised. [ 6 ] Looking back from three decades later, in the book Strategy Safari (1998), management scholar Henry Mintzberg and colleagues said that Business Policy: Text and Cases "quickly became the most popular classroom book in the field", widely diffusing its authors' ideas, which Mintzberg et al. called the "design school" model (in contrast to nine other schools that they identified) of strategic management, "with its famous notion of SWOT" emphasizing assessment of a company's internal and external situations. [ 8 ] [ 32 ] [ 31 ] However, the textbook contains neither a 2 × 2 SWOT matrix nor any detailed procedure for doing a SWOT assessment. [ 6 ] Strategy Safari and other books identified Kenneth R. Andrews as the co-author of Business Policy: Text and Cases who was responsible for writing the theoretical part of the book containing the SWOT components. [ 8 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] More generally, Mintzberg et al. attributed some conceptual influences on what they called the "design school" (of which they were strongly critical) to earlier books by Philip Selznick ( Leadership in Administration , 1957) and Alfred D. Chandler Jr. ( Strategy and Structure , 1962), [ 8 ] with other possible influences going back to the McKinsey consulting firm in the 1930s. [ 32 ] [ 35 ] However, a 2023 history of SWOT by Richard W. Puyt and colleagues criticized Mintzberg's "vilification of SWOT" and Mintzberg's apparently poor knowledge of the LRPS at Stanford. [ 36 ] Puyt et al. considered the LRPS to be the originator of SWOT (via SOFT) and said that the claim of Mintzberg and others that SWOT was invented at, or disseminated by, Harvard Business School is an "academic urban legend". [ 36 ] By the end of the 1960s, the four components of SWOT (without using the acronym) had appeared in other publications on strategic planning by various authors, [ 37 ] and by 1972 the acronym had appeared in the title of a journal article by Norman Stait, a management consultant at the British firm Urwick, Orr and Partners. [ 38 ] By 1973, the acronym was well-known enough that accountant William W. Fea, in a published lecture, mentioned "the mnemonic, familiar to students, of S.W.O.T., namely strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats". [ 39 ] Early examples of a 2 × 2 SWOT matrix are found in John Argenti's book Systematic Corporate Planning (1974) [ 40 ] and in a 1980 article by management professor Igor Ansoff (but Ansoff used the acronym T/O/S/W instead of SWOT). [ 4 ] In the 1960s Ansoff had worked with the LRPS, where the SOFT approach originated. [ 41 ] In popular culture [ edit ] Television: In the 2015 Silicon Valley episode "Homicide" (Season 2, Episode 6), Jared Dunn ( Zach Woods ) introduces the Pied Piper team to SWOT analysis. Later in that episode Dinesh ( Kumail Nanjiani ) and Gilfoyle ( Martin Starr ) employ the method when deciding whether or not to inform a stunt driver that the calculations for his upcoming jump were performed incorrectly.

The SWOTs perspective is often used to pose questions for strategic management (e.g., Ansoff, 1980). Steiner's (1979) 'WOTS' approach, Rowe, Mason and Dickel's (1982) WOTS-UP, and Delbecq's (1989) 'TOWS' framework identify three of many derivations.

What Andrews and his colleagues in the Business Policy course resolutely refused to do—and the main reason his ideas largely disappear from the subsequent history of strategy—was to agree that there were standard frameworks or constructs that could be applied to analyzing a business and its competitive situation. Oh, they might allow one, perhaps because they had helped develop it: so-called SWOT analysis, which called for looking at the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats besetting an enterprise. ^ Hill & Westbrook 1997 , p. 47: "The work of Kenneth Andrews has been especially influential in popularizing the idea that good strategy means ensuring a fit between the external situation a firm faces (threats and opportunities) and its own internal qualities or characteristics (strengths and weaknesses)." ^ McKinsey, James Oscar (1932).

[Music] Robin you're muted I gotta hello welcome everyone thank you for joining us tonight I want to uh start by thanking you for coming to our second event of our 20125 teaching week experiments with AI and it is wonderful to see so many folks joining us tonight um I just have a few words to say before we get to our uh main event tonight gen is something that some of our colleagues have been thinking about and working on for decades uh but for many of the rest of us it has been a rather abrupt introduction to this technology over the past two years years as both individuals and a grou as a group I think it's fair to say we have mixed feelings there's excitement there's dread and everything in between and there's a lot of questions and a natural response for many of us in in higher education and Academia is to experiment and that is what we get to hear about from our colleagues tonight you will hear a lot more about our presenters and their work in a moment uh but I wanted to take a moment to recognize our colleague Michael tassio assistant Vice Provost for educational Innovation Michael has been integral in helping our campus understand and respond to the impact of gen AI on all aspects of our work including teaching and learning and he's been a leader in our teaching Center in helping us help instructors navigate this technology from whatever standpoint they have on how to bring or not bring this technology into their classrooms I really wanted to just um express my appreciation for his work uh in this area and also to bring tonight's event to our campus I'd also like to thank all of our presenters for generously sharing their experimentation and expertise with us tonight um lastly I want to alert you uh to our annual convocation um this year on April 24th 2025 which will be relevant to tonight's topic we will be welcoming Dr SAA VI Vian author of un social media and the Google isation of everything to campus his talk is entitled High Cost of Outsourcing thought on the ideology of artificial intelligence and we'll be engaging in discussion with our own Dr PR vanad uh about how we as Educators should be thinking about these Technologies on our scholarship and in our classrooms and with that I welcome you and I'm excited to hear all of the presentations tonight thank you so much um Robin it's such an honor to be here with you and to be celebrating uh teaching week with all of you thank you so much to all of the attendees for joining and thank you for the panelist uh for sharing um the experimentation that you've been able to do so far um with AI and your teaching and learning um so what I'm going to do a little bit about myself I'm Michael assistant Vice provos for educational Innovation and I'm delighted to be facilitating um the presentations tonight and then also the Q&A that will follow um I'm going to talk a a few minutes about the current state of teaching and learning with generative Ai and then each of our esteem panelists will share how they're using AI in their teaching or how they're supporting campus practice in infrastructure for AI after the panelist um presentations we're going to engage all of you in a discussion where we'd very much like to feature your questions um personally I find it useful to take notes um during events like this to hold my questions and I encourage you to do the same but I also want to alert you to the Q&A button that you'll see in the bottom of zoom and you could put your questions directly into that the way that we've set up this webinar is so that you can see each other's questions and you can upvote questions we want to be able to get to those questions so please add them there and we're not planning to do Q&A after each mini presentation we're planning to hold it to the end with the exception maybe of us uh answering some of the questions in text as we go there's already been a question as you'll see about what whether or not this is being recorded and it is being recorded and you could contact TLC on Friday or so to be able to get the recording okay um please ask questions we want to see them we want to answer them as best we can um teaching week uh is just it's is just the second time that we've had teaching week and it's such an amazing way for us to be able to celebrate the really vulnerable and caring act that so many of you engage in in the teaching work that you do um it's a time of reflection on the care and the effort that Educators including so many of you that are on this call put into your practice of teaching and you know itd be remiss to not mention that in recent years disruption to teaching has become very common I'm just going to name a few of these disruptions they're not all of them um but to start with the racial Uprising in response to the police murders of George Floyd and ban Taylor the covid-19 pandemic that caused such an immediate shift to mediating instruction through tools like Zoom changes to the climate that have exacerbated our storms and buyers which we've seen well in Santa Cruz uh labor actions like we're experiencing this week that can cause difficulty in getting to campus budgetary impacts that shift models for how we teach and how we support teaching teams and courses reductions to the availability of federal funds that touch all ass aspects of University work and finally educational technologies that can make it easier for students to Outsource their learning these are all huge disruptions and in the midst of all of that what I've seen emerging as a kind of pedagogy that's in response to that disruption and all of the people who are going to be speaking with us tonight have so much experience in doing this and in the best examples including from all of them I've seen leading tenants of curiosity care for stud students and resilience and it's this curiosity that I've really seen driving the asking of questions that can give rise to new ways of thinking and teaching care for students that take seriously the conditions that they face in their personal lives that treat them as individuals and a resilience that's seen through the use of networks and communities that give Sol less and support and it's in these circumstances that I've seen a lot of creativity and even playfulness in the use of generative Ai and teaching and learning and I'm really grateful that will'll have the opportunity to learn from our colleagues tonight about how they're using generative AI okay um I'm going to share my screen and I'm going to show some data from a couple of sources and what I'm trying to do here is to really set the scene for how our students are using generative AI based on what they say there's two sources this first one is ukq or University of California undergraduate experience survey these are the D data tables for 2024 the survey is run every two years as many of you know and uh sometimes questions are added in response to new circumstances and this last time the new circumstance was chat GPT so in this first uh data set you see students reflecting on use and I want to call her attention to three uses that students are employing brainstorm for writing a project or presentation research a topic and studying for exams and so you know when when the survey is done is important it was in Spring of 24 so generative a is still somewhat new to our students but already you see these cases in which there are clear uses that they are employing it in their lives as students this data is just for our campus but if you disaggregate it to include all of the campuses you'll see very similar results okay this uh data this question is I think really important for us tonight I want to draw our attention to these two questions I understand how the use of AI can be detrimental to my learning we see students saying at 40% that they agree and at strongly agree 40% so 80% here agree or strongly agree that they see how a could be detrimental learning on the other hand uh this question is I understand how the use of a I can enhance my learning and we see agree at 33% strongly agree at 23% or about 55% overall I think this is good news for us I think that this shows a critical awareness from our students about how AI can be detrimental learning and the ways in which it can help and so I think it's really important to keep this in mind as we consider the AI literacy maybe or even ethics that students have and they think in how they think about using education Technologies okay this next survey set and there's just one more slide after this before we get started this is from the UC Davis Center for educational Effectiveness on generative AI student use they expanded the question set to add more questions and they're running the survey again right now so we'll have additional data soon this is about how students use it again so understanding a difficult topic checking for spelling or grammar errors and then finally 15% at translating they also looked at ethics this is important to keep in mind especially you know for myself at least working in the teaching Center I hear from a lot of instructors that are struggling with students improper use of generative Ai and writing assignments in particular 89% of students say it's unethical to paraphrase using generative a without acknowledgement unethical to copy content directly at 90% And unethical to write an entire paper without citing generative a at 93% so again I just want to set the stage here I think that our students are already employing some kind of AI literacy and how they think about using generative eye and I think that's important for starting this conversation to see some of the really exciting ways that our instructors are using it in their classes okay um I chose this image for a lot of reasons love the cautionary elements of it a lot of orange it's crazy like the internet is for which these AI tools large language models are scraping their data but importantly it shows the human element of doing the heavy lifting of what it's like to teach with generative Ai and so I'm going to welcome into the conversation our speakers tonight we have Benjamin Breen associate professor of History Pedro Morales almazon associate teaching professor of mathematics Adam Smith associate professor of computational media and then we're very lucky to also have with us Aisha Jackson Vice Chancellor for information technology generative AI of course requires infrastructure and thinking about policy and practice so we're excited to be able to hear from her as well um I'm going to introduce speakers and then they're going to present I'm just going to do one at a time the first presentation will be by Benjamin Breen um Ben teaches classes on early modern Europe environmental history the history of science technology and medicine from TW um from 2015 to 2017 he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Society of fellows and Humanities at Columbia University and also a lecturer in their history Department he received his PhD in history from the University of Texan at Austin and his first book the age of intoxication origins of Global Drug trade was published in 2019 his second book which made a lot of news last year tripping on Utopia Margaret me the Cold War and the troubled birth of psychedelic science appeared on many yearend best of list and even earned Professor Breen and interview on Fresh Air I think interestingly for all of us tonight he's working on a couple books right now including one called ghost of the Machine age a family and Empire and the prehistory of AI Professor Breen welcome so much and thank you for sharing with us hi everyone and um thank you so much Robin and Michael for for the introduction and um setting the stage I uh I'm really happy to be talking to you all I'm going to speak quickly because I want to cover a fair amount of ground but beforehand I just wanted to say number one it's great to be having this discussion and I think it's really good like Michael said to be critical of the really detrimental effect that AI is having specifically for people like me this humanists who are accustomed to using the essay format in assignments there's no sugar coding that it really screwed up the way that we develop assignments and grade and think about our work and it's something that everyone who does written assignments is grappling with um but also to talk about the creative and experimental and interesting to me interesting aspects of what generative AI can do in the classroom which I also find quite exciting so I'm going to be talking about the fun Parts as it were mostly um but I also do very much empathize with people uh who are have a very negative view on this because what they've experienced is students cheating by completely generating essays with chat gbt and that sucks and there's no getting around that um the other thing I want to say is thank you to pravan and in L in linguistics and Zach Zimmer in literature because a lot of what I'm just about to talk about was sort of collaboratively um developed from talking to them so first of all I'm just going to kind of um I'm going to share my screen and just go I don't have slides I'm just going to show two demos that I've made of educational history simulation games which I to a certain extent have used already in the classroom and I'm really looking forward to using but I'm also looking forward to developing this as a sort of genre of teaching tool because you can iteratively change them you can add new information to them you can totally reshape the way they look and I find that really exciting so the very First beginning of this is that I was teaching uh a medieval Europe class and also a history meth methods class in 2023 um and very quickly I've been interested in AI for years partly because my wife is a AI researcher so cat gbt when it came out was very much on my mind um and you know I immediately could see the effect on students in terms of the negatives and it was clear that assigning 10-page essays in short form discussion posts it's not going to work very well um in history and many Humanities Fields where it's like read this PDF it's a five-page PDF or 20 Page PDF and write your thoughts about it or summarize it it's so easy to to just get chaty PT to do that for you that it really did immediately manifest in our classrooms at the same time I personally found it fascinating so I was doing things like dumping in a 100 Pages document uh in the public domain you know from 18th century or something like that and having it explain things to me I was learning languages with it I'm learning farsy and it was really helpful for learning conversational farsy um but it also was just like weird there was just like a weirdness to the way generative AI specifically lm's work that I've found interesting for a couple years now and the main thing I settled on as a teaching tool was historians try to get students to think critically and creatively about primary sources so you you can give them a 20page primary source from the past but you can also ask them to think about how it can be manipulated how it can be analyzed what it looks like uh when you approach it as a constructed object as it were you know historical documents are preserved by Librarians they're annotated with metadata in some cases they're censored or suppressed and so all of that critical ways of thinking about sources is really important to how we teach so my idea was to create a history simulation prompt for chat gbt where you basically just give it a primary source and say Riff on this roleplay based on this Source make up a text based simulation uh of based on the source so for instance in the classroom we started doing things like giving it um uh some sources related to UCSC in 1973 and just have it make up a day in the life of a random madeup student in 1973 and this is a wrote about this I have a newsletter um where I I kind of first wrote about this in 2023 and and tried out some different um theories of of how we can use a llms in particular as a teaching tool in history in a way that gets students to think critically and actually do writing based on analysis of sources but it's not an essay so I haven't given up on essays but I'm going to start doing them in the classroom as blue books mostly and I'm also trying to think of ways to get students to be engaged with sources and in this new modality of working with them as it were as input as data in generative AI so I played around with different like scenarios basically and initially it was quite primitive so I from my Medieval Europe class made a a series of prompts that simulate getting the plague in 1348 the Bubonic plague epidemic was one of the most impactful things in history what did it actually feel like to get the plague um and so I did it in three different places Damascus Renaissance Italy or sorry medieval Italy and Paris and I threw in just a little bit of primary sources in these because the the window the context window at that time in 2023 was quite small so I just gave it tiny little sources like the plague attack Gaza trap set siden and Beirut next it directed as shooting arrows to Damascus there the plague set like a lion on a throne and S blah blah blah and it it was interesting how much an llm if given just that initial motive and a little bit of material a little bit of context um was able to just spin out these amazing unique role playing scenarios that were text based but students did them in the classroom in pairs and discussed what they would do next and then we had a group discussion about the results and it was actually pretty exciting I was like very pleased with how that worked students were really into it it got them to do the reading because the way I set up these prompts was that you have to kind kind of have done reading in the the textbook and in the primary source that week to know how to navigate the scenario that you're in and uh that got me thinking you know in this case sure yeah it was just an in-class activity there's no grading attached to it so there it really didn't have any purchase as it were in terms of getting them to really do the reading it mostly just engaged them and so they did the reading because it was a novelty and fun then I got to thinking what if you actually make a standalone game so before I had just been giving them a prompt to literally copy and paste into chat chbt what if you make a platform and you actually have an assessment agent or tool that is another llm that actually reads what students do in this historical simulation and assesses how historically accurate it was and what they entered and also the sophistication of their analysis so I play around with these two ideas Charles Darwin simulator when he goes to Galapagos Island on the Voyage of the beagle in 1835 and uh my own field of history of medicine a simulator of what it was like to be an apothecary in 17th century Mexico City um I mostly just picked that because I had actual sources that I could use that I had photographed myself and that were based on real people and so the thinking here is that these are just mockups of games these are not real games that I've yet made um but for instance I'm here at this point I'm think it's 2024 when I wrote this I was thinking if you simulate Charles Darwin for instance on Galapagos doing scientific analysis for History of Science class just to teach students what was it like to be a naturalist or a scientist in the 19th century how did they think differently from contemporary scientists what was it like to be Darwin what you know just the basic fundamentals of The History of darwinian Thought um you know if traditional game represents knowledge literally is just little tokens they're just little game they're little purple things but an llm could actually assess the students knowledge their input into it could then be assessed with a prompt like this you are assessing player input for a text based game the player assumes the role of Darwin players score points on a 0 to 10 Scale based on their ability to observe write and theorize about species they encounter and so that's really interesting because that's completely Dynamic it's interactive it's something that I can be given as a teacher it doesn't it's not like a closed loop I as a human teacher would then read that assessment and comment on it and give my own grade but it provides a new source of data about what students are writing that is not like grading an essay it's something entirely new but it's still mobilizing and assessing historical knowledge um and so this was a very primitive like little mockup that I made of of Charles Darwin walking around trying to find find species and collect them and analyze them what's so interesting about generative AI right now is that it it's getting so good at coding that after writing about this and I made this little mockup of the Apothecary simulation game as well just on Photoshop right it was just an imagination of what it might look like um and also a fun thing here is that language can be toggled you could toggle for instance early modern Spanish and all the dialogue could be in 17th century Spanish kind of interesting in that sense too um but I actually spent the summer and now I'm spending some time uh as well actually learning how to code and building these games so just in the past few days Claude Sonet 3.7 was released which is a very good coding tool it's brand new and I was able to just make the Darwin game um so this is my prototype of it and it's interactive so it starts out you're Darwin you're landing on one of the islands the gapos island there you are post office Bay which is where Darwin actually landed um and you just walk around so you have the ability to just type in let's see you spot movement a group of brown birds hopping fearlessly near a giant tortoise the tortoise continues its grazing so you can write approach tortoise and observe it and then when you submit that it sends that input to the llm makes an API call and on the back end there's a whole prompt with primary sources and real historical like evidence and you know data about Darwin now it says the tortoise stands before you and you can say collect giant tortoise so now here on collected specimen we have a giant tortois and then this little thing where it says Darwin is contemplating is the llm generating a text with great care you approach tortoise blah blah blah but here's the interesting thing when you click it now you have these different scientific tools that are available to 19th century naturalists so you can do visual observation magnifying lens dissection you can do field notes sample collection calipers measurement so let's say measure which Dimensions measure the shell and so this is the part where students input things and I would actually have them read Darwin's field notes from the Galapagos Islands and then I would assess them based on how well they demonstrate an awareness of how Darwin thought and the kind of tools he did so if they said something like discover Evolution it would be like no that's not what we're trying to learn here he didn't know about Evolution yet he was operating in an earlier Enlightenment framework of how science worked that was quantitative but it was not darwinian yet you know um and so you can keep doing all these things uh where you can use different tools to analyze the specimen you can talk to your um Darwin had a servant Sims Covington so now these are actual real people and on the back end the llm is being given information and actual quotes about those people um and then you can have a conversation with this working class guy who worked for Darwin and so there's like all these like potential for getting people getting students to think about class getting them to think about uh travel and the nature of like what it was like to live in a premodern world where it took years to travel somewhere um and getting them to actually kind of experientially see in a sense what it was like to be these historical figures obviously this is not an accurate fully accurate depiction of what it was like to be Darwin but digging into the history was really interesting because for instance I found out while researching this game that there was actually a prison colony of political prisoners from Ecuador on the island where Dar Darwin was studying the tortoises and finches and he actually met the guy who ran the prison Colony so I added that to the game and now you can walk to the prison colony and talk to the governor there um and the thing is you can actually add primary sources as well this is also a little feature that I'm playing around with check memory so you can give primary sources about Darwin's past and have those be kind of interactively generated as so far as they relate to the things that just happened in the game um so that is one thing um the other thing I've been doing is the Apothecary game and this one's a little bit more well-developed but a little bit not as good-looking actually because I built it last year um so in this there's patient who come to your door asking for recipes and medicines um in this case the patient is knocking at the door so this is based on a real person so Maria coelo was an actual person in my first book who was um actually persecuted by the Inquisition and basically exiled to Brazil I'm imagining if she showed up in in Mexico City a few years later under an assumed name still working as an apothecary which is basically a pharmacist um and so these are actually real people like Anna Doo was an actual person and so I have adopted uh from actual primary sources which you can read in the original by clicking on it I have kind of adapted them these as patients and they have these symptoms so just she has a cough and she struggles to breathe she also has a secret um and you can then go through mix different drugs so for instance for her for a cough we might mix together we might distill sugar and Senna and camper and this is actually teaching students how Pharmacy worked this is actually like a real medicine that existed in um this 18th century I'm doing this by giving it primary sources and then you can prescribe the medicine to her and you can decide how you want to to prescribe it let's say it's um topical and you can charge your money and then this is the assessment part you can actually see whether students do a good job as pharmacists in the 18th century whether they have a good bedside manner um the the prescription was ineffective and so there's like some interesting stuff here where it's not just in the simulation was it effective but also it's generating a little running journal and you can actually ask students to write an um I decided to prescribe camper because our reading last week mentioned that it was used for Respiratory for for uh colds you know and then you can actually have students annotate their Journal um and submit that as an assignment you can also just have fun with it I made this fun on purpose I I think it's just interesting to kind of experiment with different um ways of teaching that involve games that involve um role playing that involve simulations and the most interesting thing is that you can actually make them yourself so this is Claude you can just all all both of these ideas just began as Claude artifacts where I just asked Claude to help me prototype an idea and you can do that with students in the classroom too so that's what I'm really excited about in particular not just those two very Niche little games that I just showed cuz honestly 17 Cent apothecaries Charles Darwin not like universally applicable but those are proofs of concept because that type of thing that kind of simulation experience can be done for literally anything as long as you have data and expertise you can do it for many different disciplines specifically history it makes sense to me but I can imagine it for like medical schools teaching legal reasoning in law schools those are the two that I've thought a lot about and I think there's like enormous potential there um not just for assessment because that's what I'm exploring now like how do you actually read through what students write in that and actually make it into an assignment where they have to demonstrate the ability that to understand the reading and deploy it in the games but also just teaching students how to use AI themselves getting them to actually make these um versions of this is a really good experiential Hands-On learning for getting them to use gener generative AI in a way that is not based on cheating by having it just autogenerated paper it's something complex demanding and fun and novel so for me that's been the fun thing about the last couple years of AI and I hope that was interesting thanks that was so interesting then thank you so much for that and then um yeah look at all of the replies coming in well well deserved um I'm so glad at the end of that you mentioned um the topic of Hands-On experience for students and what it's like to learn alongside them these new technologies I hope that's a topic that we can return to in our discussion um after presentations um Pedro you can you can come on camera now um I'm so excited next to introduce Pedro Morales alazon who is an associate teaching professor of mathematics Pedro's interest in mathematics started while in high school where he became part of the guamal and math team after obtaining a degree in math Ma matics and in electronics engineering from University s Carlos De Guatemala here and do PhD in mathematics from Baylor University Pedro is deeply interested in many areas of mathematics but specifically spectral Zeta functions and their applications to number Theory Quantum field theories and related areas he's also interested in mathematics education which is how I I got to know Pedro um Active Learning experiential learning quantitative reasoning math improv and Outreach I've personally been struck by Pedro's interest in being an educator leader on our campus and lifting up the work of graduate students and mentoring them in teaching roles thank you Pedro um last year Pedro was honored by the academic senate committee on teaching with an excellence and teaching Award with the added distinction of the Ron Ruby recipient for the educator of the year in physical and biological scien Sciences Pedro we're excited to hear from you thank you well thanks for for the opportunity and um yeah I'm I'm going to follow Ben in in thinking how to to be I don't know challenged I I guess by um the the coming of of of all these new technologies and how we can actually use it to better support our students um I actually think that it's very interesting that um comparing a little bit of Michael's um data that that that showed um earlier about how students perceive the usage of AI in their own studying and their own learning it's really interesting to see that a lot of them actually try to avoid it um even in my own classes I I constantly ask them how how they they they use um AI for my class and for other classes so currently right now I'm teaching calculus 2 it's math 19B and I have about 200 students um and I try to to keep up with them to see U what what is going through their minds and a lot of them actually um actively try to avoid it because they're very aware that it can be dangerous for their own learning um at the same time other people actually try to use it for um some of the uh topics that Michael described earlier like um researching a topic or um helping them understand a concept by going back and forth so I'm in that sense I'm I'm hopeful that um our students are also exploring um I want to say effective ways of using AI for their own learning um I'm also on the same page as Ben that some students might use him in in a different way um but I think that that has always happened um whether it is a chat GPT or a friend or someone that they contact to get help with their homework I think that that's a byproduct of um just having people teaching and learning in these classes so um my intention has been trying to figure out ways in which which um students can effectively use um these Technologies and support their own their own learning so I I have a couple things that I want to share with everyone um and I'm going to share this first one and it has a little bit of audio so um I think it works and um we'll see if if um this actually works well so this tool is called notebook LM it part of the Google suite and one of the um challenges for me is that we cannot actually use it with our own UCSC um um username this can only be used at the moment with a personal Google account so just I want to to to to be very transparent about that because I've been trying to use this this tool with my own students but um it's not an official tool for my class because of that reason that not everyone might get access to it only people that have a personal Google account so in a nutshell what this particular tool if you have not seen it before is is basically a chat GPT that you can fine-tune with your own documents so in here for an example what I'm showing to you is um the the class notes actually from my class today um so the class that I taught today earlier um today in my calculus course which is about um sequences so this is this is the class notes that I use that that I provide to my students and I upload it to to this um llm so it is fine-tuned to that what what what that means is that basically the the structure of the llm is giving the general language kind of like the generating um grammar that is humanlike that is readable but the content itself is going to be fine-tuned to the documents that I uploaded so this is only regarding my class um in some sense I'm basically telling the llm what I want it to talk about very similar to what Ben did with the games I'm giving the context that I want to use for my class so it is text based as as the other chat gpts and Geminis and Claud and everything else but this is one of the nice features you can actually generate an audio overview of your materials which I think is very very uh interesting so I'm going to just play a few seconds for this because the whole thing generated was 10 minutes so that's a little bit much but I want to show you at least a few seconds of what come ups with basically again I uploaded my own notes um the thing started generated audio on itself and I literally told it to generate a college level podcast that was for about 10 minutes so you can see that it's exactly 10 minutes in here so I'm going to play it and hopefully hopefully the Sound Works well welcome to the Deep dive ready to explore sequences and limits super important stuff for anyone tackling college level math yeah it really is a foundational topic we've got some awesome Source material to guide us by the end you'll see math in a whole new light it's like and let me actually fast forward a little bit so that was the introduction I think that sound was working well let me just randomly put it right in the middle so you can get a snippet of what they actually talk about we call that convergence okay like imagine a racetrack where the runners are getting closer and closer to the finish line but they never actually cross it yeah I can picture that but what about the sequences that like never settle down what about them those are the Divergent ones H the rebels they might just zoom off to Infinity like a rocket blasting off or maybe they oscillate back and forth can't make up their minds I see so that was a little bit of of the of the sample over there if you know a little bit of math you probably heard a couple of things that were familiar and I really want to focus on on those two things because this is the example that that I use with my students um first of all I didn't give any of those examples in my source materials the um the llm the not notebook LM actually came out with the examples um the one about the runner getting closer and closer to the finish line some people might know that one already that's one of Zeno's Paradox it's one of the Paradox of movement that we actually use to teach um limits is one of the basic things um that that students are faced to so it's very interesting that um just with my notes the llm actually picks up on all of these examples that are already out there so that's one interesting thing on the positive side on the not so positive side um if you were paying attention the the audio was saying Divergent and actually it is Divergent so even though it's trying to say the right thing if it doesn't have enough data about the particular thing that you're talking about it might make a little bit of some mistakes whenever you use it so I'm going to switch my screen quickly because I generate the audio for my class with the topics um based on the notes that I have and then what I do is I create a canvas assignment so I'm going to share my screen so you can see it um I just did a screenshot so you don't see my my student data but basically what I do is I create a discussion a canvas discussion that is basically that podcast that that I just uh showed clips of and what they what my students have to do is they have to listen to that and they have to find what is interesting about it what is confusing or Pro problematic because the audio that generates is Loosely based on the notes that U that I give it but it's not it's not super truthful it hallucinates a lot and actually I asked my students to identify the hallucinations that it creates so actually what they have to do let me just show you a screenshot of of what they they need to do it's a canvas discussion meaning that it's a post they listen to the audio and then they reply to it and they can like the replies from other students um and they can create their own they can also reply to to them but you can see that they are actually interacting with the with the material in a different way instead of me say for example uploading a video or me just putting a recording from my class they actually are interacting with this thing and not only that they are actually evaluating how good it is of course we talk in class that all of these um Technologies are are prone to hallucinations so the the the content that they're getting is not going to be 100% truthful and that's part of their assignment is trying to figure out what are are the things that are true and what are the things that are not true so in that sense I believe that in a similar way to what Ben is doing the interaction actually provides a different way to to engage with the content and I really like to to focus in that evalu ation part of the interaction I think that that's very powerful so I want to share a couple other things um before my time is up that kind of like follow the same the same idea so another um experiment that that I've been playing with is um basically generating things from an llm and let me show you this one in particular so I'm just using Gemini in here the Google one and one of the things that I like is precisely spotting mistakes I think that that's a very powerful way for students to learn a topic so in here for example I asked Gemini to generate a problem from my class cuse 2 but I wanted to generate a problem that had a single wrong step and basically what I give my students is the problem and the proposed solution from d llm i don't tell them that is generated by the llm but I tell them hey this is the problem and this is the solution it has one mistake so the activity in our class is to actually have them discuss where the mistake happens and this is very helpful for me because I don't have to come up with thousand different ways of creating this I can simply just use the the llm to generate that and it's very interesting to see that creative ways in which the llm actually works the the nice thing about this one is that it also kind of reasons what is the mistake and of course this is just a starting point for promoting conversations with your student um common mistakes this is something that everyone that that teaches a Calculus class know whenever we're dealing with integrals um a lot of people will will forget that plus C so I I use a lot of these things as a starting point for whatever we we are discussing in our class which I think is is is it's actually a different way to engage with them um I want to show you example um from actually from chat GPT that I like to share with my students so sometimes I actually just share this uh on canvas or even during my lecture time because um probably for the humanity side and for the English side of of um of courses um the the main problem is generating essays um so coming up with the text is one of the main issues for the math side of things the one of the main issues is that all of these llms actually are not computers they actually don't have computational engines so one particular example that that I found very interesting was a a problem that I found on the internet actually and I was trying to just assess uh chat GPT how good the um the the the prompt was going to be so this problem is very simple problem about coming up with a magic square so if you have not seen a magic square is basically a Sudoku um that's the way you can understand a magic square so you can only use a number once you cannot repeat a number but the the Restriction in here is that the the sum of the numbers in a column or a row and the two diagonals has to be the same so if I add these three numbers or for example these three numbers in this column and if I add these three numbers in this row those two sums should be the same so I asked CH GPT to actually come up with such an example um and it was it was telling me that it came up with an example so it told me the numbers that I could that I could use to to fill it up and even it showed me quote unquote that the sums were the same however if you actually pay attention the sums are not the same um this what act this is actually not true and this is a very obvious lie I mean if you actually add these numbers up this sum is not the same um and I like to use this as an example to my students that even in just very basic things Chad GPT lies to you it hallucinates and the main reason is because it is a language model it is not an arithmetic model it's not a computational model so it is not designed to actually do operations mathem iCal operations and this is of course A Very extreme um case but it's important for students to know um how much they can trust all these tools because some of them actually start using um chat GPT as some sort of calculator um but actually that's a terrible idea it is a terrible calculator and and if I try to torture it a little bit more I tell him CH GPT no you're wrong this is not right it kind of like keep pushing through like oh yeah you you were right right um sorry my mistake and it gave me another another answer but the same thing happened it was not true it it was the wrong answer um so I'd like to share that with my students so they can see that whatever they get from chat GPT they should assume that it's not 100% accurate and I think that that AI literacy part is is super important so let me show you one last thing U before my time runs up um that I started using in my class as well pretty recently and um and this was this was a combination of things so this tool is called Old ATA this is basically a chat GPT that I fine-tune to with my own file so let me just quickly share that with you um here I included my class notes I have some lecture recordings that I also feed into to the model um I have my calculus book over there um I actually uploaded my syllabus so I put all my information over there and what this thing does is that it's basically just an assistant for class so um I can ask it for example when are um the instructor's office hours and hopefully it will it will give me the right answer um I put again they information from the class and yes that's right um and this is actually accurate so these are my office hours um and I do have office hours via zoom and in person um so this is actually a pretty useful tool for students if they want to ask like just um things about um how much say for example how much are exams worth let's see if if it can come up with the with the answer over there so these are are type of questions that your students might ask you yeah so it's total of 35% of the of the total grade so it's called all at because you can just share um this with your students and it basically just um it's a chatbot for your class but because I also uploaded my own notes and my own recordings I can ask um say for example generate a um problem on sequences so that was the topic that I was talking about uh today in my class so it looks through the book through my recordings through the class notes and that's basically what is going um behind the scenes right now and again it's basically running on chat GPT that's the the back end and it just gives me something right so consider the sequence defined by this explicit formula blah blah blah and I can keep asking questions about this why does the sequence start at n equals one for an example and um the way I'm trying to Envision how to to use this more intentional for my students is not only for them to ask questions and clarification but similar to what Ben was showing about his quest in in history um I do think that um the big advantage of of having these type of chat box is to make our classes more Interactive so the idea is that they can actually keep digging further and for further not just looking for answers but actually looking at the process um I think that that's one of the biggest potentials that we have so in here is basically telling me a little bit why um we are starting from zero let me just finish this by saying um could we start it at n equals z because the main point is to to make the content more Interactive um I believe that one of the things or the potentials that we have is that we can focus on the processes and not the products so in this case yeah it does give me the right answer you can just shift that the index and starting from zero so basically um let me just share a couple of slides in here to finish um my main approach is to actually um is to actually think think about three particular things so um I want to wrap up with with this basically the tools that that I was talking about notebook LM and old ATA these are tools that I use but my activities are focusing more on the processes so I I want my students to to use these tools to generate more problems to evaluate wrong Solutions and to interact or teach a concept I think that that that can be very useful in other words my learning goals is first of all to promote more AI literacy um I want them to explore the limitations of these um llms first of all that they are just language based mathematics really doesn't align because this is basically um based on probability so exact computations are not going to perform well um I want them to identify mistakes we can ask the llms to generate something wrong or just by Nature it hallucinates a lot so I think identifying wrong things is a very um useful way for them to to understand something and then the third one is um it's basically what happens in Humanities with the essays right is is how you actually interact with a topic how you actually understand something is by interacting with that something and this is where I can see a lot of the potential in AI tools that we can make materials way more interactive it's not just passive it's not just students looking at a video or just reading a um a text but actually interacting with it and I believe that that's where the um the the the advantage of having these tools are so that's a little bit of what I wanted to to share with everyone um hopefully I I was not that scattered um I'm still playing with things I'm still um experimenting with stuff and one last thing that I want to remark as I said at the beginning is that I found very useful to just ask students how they are using AI in their own study they are also experimenting they're also exploring and that to me has given me ideas on how I can use it more effectively probably the last uh thought that I want to share on the topic of accessibility this uh old ATA that I share with you guys um I'm paying for for the subscription for the entire class because one of the things one of my personal worries and maybe we can talk about that later is that that just the access to AI tools can create a bigger Equity Gap among our students people that have money to pay for a chat GPT subscription for example actually will have more advantage that people that only use the free version or even less that they don't know that they can use the free version so in my class this old ATA I'm paying for the subscription for the entire class so at least I know that everyone has equal footing um when it comes to these type of tools so I just wanted to bring that to to everyone's attention because I think that we have to be very intentional about that so again thanks for um letting me share a little bit of the experiments that I'm doing and and thanks again Michael and Robin for organizing this thank you so much Pedro and thank you particularly for raising the issue of access and Equity at the end with educational Technologies the tradeoff is either giving up privacy you're paying and so I really appreciate you saying that and I think that's a common theme infrastructure for AI that we'll hit on later and um also that I expect Adam will raise in his talk um as he's he's paying for a service as well okay Adam um please come on screen Adam Smith is an associate professor of computational media he's a computer scientist a design researcher and a software artist Adam does technical games research for enriching the ways we create distribute consume and reflect on interactive media like apps and games his dissertation titled mechanizing exploratory game design built the design automation practice and the inter disciplinary space between game design design studies computational creativity and symbolic AI so you even see back then he was working with AI more recently Adam is experimentally integrating design Automation and to his teaching while training graduate students to develop new uses for AI and the design of interactive media um I want to note that Adam did his PhD at UC Santa Cruz and as a graduate student he was rewarded both the 2006 outstanding teaching award through Baskin engineering and again in 2007 the Excellence in teaching award for teaching assistance Through The Graduate division thank you so much for joining us Adam oh thank you I'd forgotten about the awards like I guess I must have put that on my my on my website or something uh well so I have some slides that I want to show everybody but first there's I got inspired by something that Pedro showed and the the mention earlier before how Ben was saying you can make things really quick with claw artifacts so I just in the the seconds while Pedro was finishing I went over here and I said I want you to generate a self-contained HTML page that includes math tech rendered equation I'm not even going to read all like I rapidly typed some stuff didn't spell check it at all but to make me a a kind of interactive widget here where there's like some algebra problem and you have to figure out which step like oh I think that was the wrong step you click it and you get feedback and you reset it you're like uh that was the wrong step and it's like yeah that was the wrong steps you're getting it feedback on it like this took I don't know four seconds to make uh and then I went back to watching Pedro's talk a little bit more that I thought well I don't normally teach a class where I have an algebra problem like this I want a computer programming version so one paragraph of text later and 10 seconds later there was here's some code and here's a series of steps to optimize the code and one of these steps changes the behavior of it and you have to sort of spot where in the incremental process things got changed and I haven't even read it so I didn't get it right on there but you um this this idea is sort of already moving between us instructors during during the the things now uh but that's not actually what I was going to show you I'm G to show you this thing um let see are is everything showing right there it looks like it is I'm just going to move some these things out of the way uh okay so today um oh now I finally found the the the Q&A things and I will try not to be distracted by those during it um I'm going to tell you about a system called brace U but as usual some some introduction to it first um many times when you go to talks like some of the ones that that we saw last night at the teaching Symposium there's sort of this undercurrent of doing more with more more in the sense that like uh here's you can help out your students more if you do this little bit extra thing and I think we're all in a mode where like a lot of us don't have more to give even though we want to give more um and when somebody says oh you can use generative AI to like generate more stuff and then your students can turn around and like generate all the answers to it and it's like more more more of the traditional homework thing going on and I don't want to go that way so I want to tell you about the sort of theme of doing less with less and the context being that the the class that I finished teaching in fall uh needed to be triple the size of what it was before and it's a pretty feedback intensive class uh also for complicated reasons we didn't have discussion sections when we did and the solution to scaling can't just be work many times harder uh so maybe this new generative AI thing is around like I've been doing AI for generating stuff for a long time but even to me what is now called generative AI there are many things that are that are new about it um can we make something that doesn't just lead us to lots more of this more stuff and can it help student to teacher communication rather than saying more communication that would have happened in office hours is now just students talking to chat GPT by themselves that would be like getting in the way of communication so if I could wave a magic wand on make this thing called brace it's called brace in reference to the curly braces we have in programming but also a supportive sense of a brace ideally this thing would be a technologically mediated way to extend your teaching into the nights and weekends offer unlimited support for course adjacent topics things you would love to talk to people about in office hours but you just don't have time to for when you're spread across things or a way to like personalize and translate all the sort of General text that you're sharing uh with with everybody in class so let's somehow do that with magic Sparkles um you already heard a little bit about me before one detail is uh yeah I I was here as a graduate student I was also here as an undergrad I was a transfer student from a community college I have ADHD I'm really interested in alternative ways of teaching and alternative Pathways into things because even my own pathway in here was was somewhat alternative um and a couple years ago I taught our cmpm 290a it's a special topics course and we did it as computational media education research looking into like how can we either teach people how to make and use computational Media or how do we use computational media in the teaching of any other topic so this idea of sort of technology to help with teaching has been adjacent to my research and teaching for a while usually I care about doing sort of ey Assurance generation where you when you use AI for something you get absolute guarantees about the quality that comes out generative AI stuff doesn't offer almost any guarantees at all so it's been uncomfortable for me to work with it but I've growing into it um and it's pretty common in the classes that I teach that I use the canvas API to make extensions to Canvas to support peer review or to generate thumbnails of all student projects to support people doing group formation so I'm used to like hacking around the edges and extending canvas in certain ways but this was my first experience doing that with with llms in there so for a little bit of context on this class um this is the second time we've offered it it's called cmpm 121 game development patterns roughly following the textbook that's on the screen um even though it has words like development and programming in there and games I want you to think of this as a lot like a writing course uh it's not something where students sort of battle with a code to eventually get the right answer and everyone produces the same thing everyone's projects are going in different creative directions under certain technical constraints that pulls them so they're all doing similar projects but we care about the quality of the code the readability the architecture think of it as it's not just about in in a writing class you wouldn't want it like is your argument well thought out is it put together is your evidence right did you site your sources like that sort of writing quality stuff matters in this class uh we want people to show their work across many incremental revisions so when they turn in their project they've actually turned in using Version Control 10 past versions of it leading up to that along the way and we have peer review and play testing so it's a very feedback intensive class and when I learned I needed to scale it up it was kind of scary because I have no idea how to autograde many of these things um it does take sort of linguistic judgment about the quality of stuff and how to give people useful feedback so the first time we offered the class it was it was a new prep for me we had one instructor two Tas we had 60 students which was a reasonable 30 to1 ta ratio and then we're going to offer it the next year and for complic reasons involving CLP reorganizations we had to triple the size of it hire a TA at the last minute move to a different classroom and cancel all the sections because we couldn't schedule things uh so this feedback intensive writing style class suddenly needed to be done much much bigger so you can imagine this is like a setup for like well quality is going to go down but our quantity is going to go up but we it's going to have a happy ending of course um but this is the the challenge that that we faced so I had been playing with things like uh chat gbt and Claude and so on over the over the past few months and over the summer and I thought this upcoming class what am I going to do about it um I don't want just students to on mass just have things like tat PT generate all their code and my Tas one by one look at all this generic code and can never provide useful feedback on it but I know that llms can provide useful feedback on code if you can prompt them the right way but my students are sort of novice prompters so I would like a system that is like chubbt I would like students to be able to all log in for free just with their Google accounts no passwords nobody pays for anything um I want to be able to set the instructions that are used by the system so that it responds in a way that is kind of programmable or or configurable by me and I would also like to like look at their conversations to get a sense of their thought process to see are they good prompting strategies are there bad ones what do people really do with it um um when they're not turning in a final artifact and also I really wanted it so that they could turn in their conversations from whatever chat site they're on turn those into cannabis directly so that when my ta are looking at them they're quickly scrolling through and sort of spot checking a nicely formatted conversation without the student having to produce like a a well-formatted report in the end I want them to the report should just be a byproduct of having the conversation so that's that's the vision that's what I wanted and I'm not going to click on all these links I'll share the the slides later if people want them for the web interface we used a thing called open web UI which is a it's about as easy to set up as blogging software but it offers a chat gbt like interface where you can customize the different characters you chat with that's a simple way of describing it uh it doesn't provide the llm itself it's just just the front end and you have to run it on a server for yourself I connected this to the open AI gbt 40 backend and it was important that it was the 40 version this is the one that is not just processing of text but also images and sound also even though I have I said was a writing intense class there is a lot of screenshots that my students share and those screenshots actually have clues about how their software might not be set up right or they might have a screenshot of gameplay of their game and say how do I make this thing bigger uh there is a lot of visual reasoning that turns out to be relevant um as for letting people log in I figured out a way to let them log in with their Google accounts uh it didn't know that I could do this but figured it out anyway um it it wasn't actually much code to put all this stuff together it was a lot of pre-existing building blocks that just sort of got mushed together with a bit of python and a bunch of English prompts uh and some of those big building blocks are plugging it into canvas and plugging it into GitHub the the site where my students are showing their incremental progress by putting their their code online in a public place where their friends and family can play their games and and I think the actual main development of this was like two weeks over the summer it wasn't a big part of my summer it was a fun part but it was only like two weeks um so from a teaching perspective what can we do with this well one of the first assignments that I had and I'll give you a little demo of it is um like I'll literally click to where this is on canvas reading zero meet brace or do the profile Builder activity visit the main tool for brace and they just go to brace. tools and they click chat with brace and it says sign in with single sign on simple enough uh I'll sign in with my UCSC account which is the only one that will work seconds later you're logged into to you know a place where you can type stuff and if you had a bunch of conversations they would be on the side but I cleaned it out for demo purposes and for this first assignment students were supposed to say I'm giving the students instructions you say I want to do the profile Builder activity and um just a moment uh this was an example of one of the failure cases it says okay well there is this profile Builder activity that will help us uh what do you want to do with it and I'm like I didn't see you fetch the profile Builder activity instructions so I'm sure the chatbot doesn't know what the activity is yet but I've told my students right in the assignment if you don't see it look up the documentation for this assignment tell it like use the wiki or fetch the document sometimes they need to to scold it but when they do that anything in these like uh angle brackets gets expanded to the contents of a file that I've prepared behind the scenes so this thing called the the wiki it's a bunch of files that includes uh instructions for different activities and so on and the first part of this one is like well what language do you want to work with uh so you can say well I want to do it in Spanish and then it instantly switches to Spanish for the for the rest of of the thing and at the end it prompts you to take the summary of your preferences and to go put it into your personal system prompt so that when brace talks to you ever again it's registered your preferences and your preferences aren't it's not like sliders and checkboxes you can give it whatever advice you want on how to talk to you so it's in that very first assignment students are learning how to program it themselves just like I am programming it by providing a system prompt and there's also this little Sparkle button where I'm not going to go through the steps but that's how they would turn it back in on canvas so first assignment was mostly like set it up and turn things in and that's what sort of helped us work out the bugs in the system make sure everybody could log in um that it works across all platform uh browsers and and stuff like that because it was a big class and people have a lot of weird setups um but you've already seen the first thing of something in llm normally can't do which is fetch data that's private to the course from this this Wiki of just plain text files another assignment that I'll have you think about is we had one uh one of our post-lecture activities was today in lecture we talked about five different software engineering tools linters and type Checkers and continuous deployment or whatever it is I want want the students to think of a plausible use case for all five of those Technologies in their life and if they can't think of a plausible use case they should iterate with the chat blot to come up with one last year that was an assignment that was just like a text box and uh ta would read all those now it's a dialogue assignment and this starts off it says students click this link to start the dialogue activity they don't even need the rest of it they just click this link to get started it goes to the brace site because their opening message was the name of the assignment brace says it looks like you're trying to access an assignment let me get that for you and at this point brace has read the same text from canvas oops not that one has read this thing which includes like uh oops sorry I keep closing the wrong tabs in the lo3 dialogue there's a block down here it says brace I want you to run a structured interview with my students where you do these things so the the sort of code for running the activity is right there on canvas so that like if there's a mistake in it my Tas can go in and fix it as well they don't need to be system admins it's like canvas is the way that we program it now and again when they're done with it they submit it back to Canvas and um actually I shouldn't show you other people's homework but you can imagine in speed grader there is a formatted view of this um and it's very easy to grade um dialogues when you know that everyone is sort of following all the same script nobody had to deal with choosing the fonts and file formats or stuff like that you quickly scroll through it it says looks like they followed instructions two out of two points onto the next one very very quick to grade it was still human graded but uh very lightweight because a lot of the feedback that you would want to give to students was [Music] [Music] behind the scene that was judging them like they could see that brace is just following instructions from canvas just like they are and sometimes if brace goes off the rails they know what the intent of the assignment is and they can nudge brace to get back on the rails to be like weren't we having an interview about software engineering tools and it will say oh yes you're right let's go on to number three um and uh next thing uh this the last of the assignments I'll show you uh this is the one that I'm most proud of it pulls together all the different parts of the system so I had an assignment that after lecture 16 I really wanted my students to get started on the assignment called d3a and d3a you know it's a canvas assignment and I said students this assignment is intended to help you get started I want you to Fork the starter code make a button that when you click it something pops up and um when you've done that and pushed your code to the public where people can play it come back here to Canvas start a link start a conversation with brace and it will check that thing out for you and then here in sort of gray on light text is like brace here are your secret instructions uh please check that they start Fork the right starter code that they successfully made an update that the code that they give you a link to is not the instructor's code again um so we can do a little test of this um could you confirm your referring to assignment yes um I don't know why I didn't fetch it directly fch it awkwardly the backend llm has changed Behavior over the last month so somewhere in here it's like pre please provide your link so I can assist you further so let me go get a plausible link I can put in here this isn't a student code I'm linking to my own starter code and it will say okay uh to check on your progress I will need to go look at the recent workflow runs in the that Repository it looks like your project was successful however it seems like none of the commits were contributed by by someone other than Adam Smith uh but meanwhile I can check in your code to see if you've added something and it's like well um I see that there was a to-do marker if you want to add a simple button here's a way to do it so think of it as if the student thought they were done it can tell them not quite but here's a way to get you to a done State and this isn't about finishing the project this is about getting over that activation energy of like I just need to make any visible change to my project and push it to the to the public version uh so it's primed the moment the student sort of falls off the rails to help them get back on there and they didn't have to copy and paste their code in from anywhere else they have clicked they've clicked something on canvas it said what is your URL and they've given the URL they didn't have to copy and paste in a lot of evidence they've already in some sense their evidence to this other site that they were already using so it's sort of recycling the labor that they've already done and this assignment like I didn't even think of this assignment until after class was over that day of sitting in the picnic benches outside of the classroom in Oak college and spent 15 minutes writing this text and then went home and made dinner like normally this would be a huge amount of custom programming and automation to make something that provides instant feedback on this and it was just like on a whim I thought of this type of assignment and and deployed it and hoped it worked and I think later on that night I I rewarded the instructions a little bit after the first few people had done it and I added some clarifications but I could just do that on canvas um so you might be wondering what kind of reactions did people have uh I have a whole bunch of survey data within the class and also through the SCS just to highlight some of the things many students were like wow a Professor who doesn't say that Chachi is evil and it's going to rot your brain even though there are there aspects of that um they liked that it was being used in a different way they really love that around the support Around the Clock support sort of like the AL day ta thing that Pedra mentioned they like that they could ask these dumb questions which of course are never dumb they're actually really important questions and I like that they ask them rather than not asking them uh and at the end of the quarter oh boy people said I am the best SL worst and RoR and it's always some generative AI thing that is the reason that I'm the best or the worst extreme polarization at the end of the quarter uh one thing that stuck out stuck out to me was that someone's like wow I really wish I had this during the TA strike so there are ways in which this thing is like meaningfully overlapping lots of the responsibilities that we give to instructors and Tas it obviously can't do the whole job on its own but it can do big chunks of them in a way that I can see someone else seeing this and be like well why don't we triple the size of the class again it seemed to work um and now you only get one TA or something like that and and it might work I don't know but it feels really awkward the fact that it's involved in these labor issues as well um from a teacher perspective this is sort of me in synthesizing the Tas um the Tas couldn't look at conversations unless they were turned in but I had this like system administrator view that I could look across everything and I'll say that there was very little problematic use even the heavy users of the system were like heavily using it for pretty good stuff so I I'm glad I didn't put a rate limit on that because the people who did go deep were getting really good stuff and teaching me good techniques about how to use it usually when there was something like ah I really wish it hadn't said that almost always it was the case that the student was getting into some territory where they were referring to some really course specific thing that you would that Google or chat could never answer like I'm working on step two of the D1 assignment the only way to know what step two of D1 is to like read all the other private to the course materials so that's an example of missing context it's part of why I integrated it with canvas more and more over time um so almost all of this thing that we feared a lot about the hallucination was almost always tied to missing context and it was almost always fixable by integrating more stuff that would just stay integrated in the future uh I didn't give it the ability to like download lecture transcripts although I did test by manually pasting them there that that really does help uh or giving it the like uh PDFs that I shared with students um maybe maybe next year uh so for some broad outcomes despite the fact that we tripled the size of the course and redu made the student staff ratios unfavorable and cancel the sections about the same number of people got uh DF or W and the score distributions on the assignments was about the same despite the fact that we were degrading many other aspects of it um by the end I spent $1,000 doll of my own money I feel like it was really worth it in terms of me learning all this stuff about them I wouldn't spend $1,000 again um but it felt like it was really worth it uh for me I don't feel like I went sort of out of my normal amount of weird automation that I do for a large class because it's my style of making weird automation like that um but this this way that I could make like I could invent a new type of assignment a feedback intensive assignment that is partially autog graded and just like make it and release it in an afternoon I I didn't expect that ability in the beginning of the quarter um so this new design pattern of dialogue assignments feels like a major outcome and a really unexpected outcome was the fact that because I could see all these conversations students were having I could see them they were demonstrating either conceptions or misconceptions and like I had visibility into their thought process in a way that I've never had before and I could make like a broad canvas announcement that I said oh I noticed some people are struggling with this here's a tip nobody had ever actually asked me the specific question about it but I noticed a few people had done something I was sort of passively monitoring you a surveillance sense I guess um but in that sense it was increasing my ability to understand how they are thinking and causing me to say more things to them so in that sense we are communicating more as a result of this even though the communication was mediated by this other thing at this large scale so to not use all the time here you might be wondering C can I teach with a brace to no um I built it for me as part of this experiment and it's sort of inherently designed in a way that it assumes there's exactly one teacher who is exactly the the only system in and the particular constellation of skills and access they have is exactly me so it's hard for me to think of like a revision of it that could support more than one class at a time uh because it comes down to like the system operates with certain you know API keys and credentials and I'm willing to put in my secret powers to like read from canvas but I'm not confident in the system enough to say that someone else should give me their their credentials to put into the system there is a way to work around this in the long term but it's the definitely the Enterprise grade way of doing it I'm working on it with with its so maybe over the summer I'll figure it out um the simple way out of it of like well just can you just cut canvas out of it I feel like integrating with canvas is what made so much of this very fluid and integrated and let me sort of resolve almost every time there was missing context I could just give it access to a different part of canvas like canvas Pages or something where that context would then be present um but I don't want to solve this all myself if you have any um Masters or PhD students that are curious about this stuff you can enroll this week for a cmpm 290-01 teaching with generative AI um where me and a bunch of students are going to invent more things like that and hopefully test them out in spring quarter classes uh but again always just making it up as as we go along because all the stuff is Super Fresh uh yeah that is it from me thank you so much Adam really appreciate that and um thank you Aisha for coming on um this is perfect talking about tools and using tools uh building tools even before we have process and policy in place and um Aisha Jackson is our vice Chancellor for information technology she holds a Doctorate in Education from the University of Colorado Denver she also holds a Masters in Education from the University of Florida Gainesville and a Bachelor of Arts and Elementary education from Flagler College in St Augustine Florida she joined UCSC somewhat recently in uh 2022 following a successful early career at the University of Colorado Boulder where she was at University's first assistant Vice Provost and assistant Vice Chancellor for academic Tey technology and Student Success a big title Aisha it was a role that was created to ensure the continued advancement of Campus technology and service to both faculty and students at UCSC Aisha is transforming its governance structure and integrating key new bodies including technology enhanced teaching and learning and more recently the AI Council which she'll be talking about now thank you thank you Michael and I'm so grateful for this opportunity to wrap up this part of our session with inform information about the UC Santa Cruz AI Council um as Illustrated in the presentations made by my fellow panelist there is a lot of experimentation with AI happening in the teaching learning space at the UC Santa Cruz campus AI has a potential to strengthen our mission and transform how UC Santa Cruz functions not just in teaching but in research and administration as well at the same time um we heard a little bit from Adam and Pedro there it there's some complex challenges that require thoughtful attention to ethical considerations data privacy and responsible use in order to leverage the possibilities and navigate the challenges at the campus level um I'm excited to share um if you haven't heard that we have established the UCC Santa Cruz AI Council there are five components to the AI council's charge first opportunities and collaboration as we heard there's a already amazing work happening with a on this campus the AI Council aims to provide scaffolds for this work across the UC Santa Cruz Community by creating avenues for engagement with AI and promoting cross-disciplinary um collaboration these scaffolds will include providing advice on the development and training um of our staff faculty and students um to help them develop the literacies that um some of our my panelists discussed um such as writing and editing good prompts um those literacies are needed to engage effectively and ethically with AI our next um component is principles policies and ethics in early 2024 its issued security and privacy guidance related to the use of generative AI um but the landscape is changing every every day so um one of the things that it did is it outlined prohibited uses permitted uses and guidance on procurement and Licensing we need to build on this work as well as the work um that is been being done at the UC Office of the President to establish principles for the ethical and responsible use of AI on our campus we will also be giving strategic advice such as recommending strategic initiatives to maximize ai's benefits um we will be providing guidance on the use and integration of AI across research teaching student life and operations and the final two components will help to advance the integration of tools like Google's notebook LM which Pedro demonstrated for us um within UC Santa Cruz systems as well as Investments the campus might make to ensure Equitable access to tools like all day ta and um um affordability of tools so that our faculty don't have to um Dole out money um to do this type of experimentation the AI Council will be supporting risk assessments of AI related risks including cyber security threats legal considerations and unintended consequences in alignment with UC policy and compliance requirements drawing from best practices in higher education and Industry we will also be developing protocols to ensure the safe and secure use of AI particularly in research and data sensitive environments and finally the last component of our charge is infrastructure um the AI Council will offer recommendations on the licensing development and maintenance of the UC Santa Cruz AI technical infrastructure including Computing resources data storage and tools as we recommend infrastructural Investments we'll be thinking about ethics Equity Financial sustainability security and privacy as well as the environmental impacts um that AI has all of those things will be considered as we um make some decisions in order to advance our charge the AI council is made up of individuals representing units from across the UC Santa Cruz campus taking a cross functional approach was critical because AI has a possibility of impacting every part of our campus Michael tassio and I serve as chairs for the committee representing academic Affairs the teaching and learning center and information technology Services Adam Smith represents Basin School of Engineering we also have representatives from Arts student affairs Human Resources the Student Health Center information technology Services the University Library office of diversity equity and inclusion Business Services I can go on and on and on um it was important though that we have an a holistic approach to AI governance on our campus given how impactful it could be throughout the AI Council started meeting in early February so we've just had two meetings we are actively working on prioritizing areas of focus for the remainder of the Academic Year I encourage you to explore the council's work through our website and to share any questions or topics that you'd like the council to address I'm sure Pedro you will have something in there about giving access to things like notebook LM um thank you so much I'm looking forward to the um QA component of our session thank you so much Aisha I really appreciate you um sharing with the campus about the AI Council that's launched so recently um Adam Pedro um please come on video as we um move into the Q&A section of this um as um Professor Breen noted in an answered question he unfortunately had to step away um to support his family um I appreciate very much that um there have been questions and that we've been dialoguing and answering them in text but I want to um lift back up uh a question that was asked earlier and the question was asked by um Professor Megan Thomas and it was about all day ta but I think it raises a larger issue about the integration of AI and generative Ai and teaching and learning environments um Professor Thomas's question was about Labor issues connected with all ATA but I wonder if we could reframe that a little bit to open the question more broadly to think about uh use of generative AI in the classroom and the labor issues it can create uh especially as you enter into a space of maybe using it for evaluating student work or for grading student work and how you're thinking about what sorts of um activities of an educator you're willing to Outsource to Ai and and what ones you're not willing to Outsource at this point maybe I go first and then we'll hear from everyone else um in my opinion that's a little bit of what can be defined with the AI Council as well um in which ways or to which extent we can use um these AI tools um I think that sometimes we we might think as binary questions like yes or no or is it good or bad and I believe that uh more meaningful questions is to which extent we can actually include these Technologies or to which extent are we expecting to to use any of these these things um and I believe that there is a spectrum right of of how many um in depth we want to go into using these tools for our class but one of the at least personally one of my principles I think it's um using machines to do things that machines can do when using humans or um taking advantage of humans to do what humans can do um I believe that um we can maybe enhance the the things that we as instructors and Tas and tutors and even just students do um by leveraging how much we can use AI into this and I think that some of the examples that we saw today kind of like are an example of that again within my own perspective I think that shifting away from products and thinking about processes is a good framework work to think about how much we want to use AI because if in my class what I only care about is the number or the answer or the essay if I focus on the product then students can use AI for the product if as an instructor I only care about the grade or the feedback then I'm focusing on the product then I would be tempted to use AI for that but if if I actually think about the process in my opinion the process is about learning then I can see how I can use this tool as a tool and not as a replacement so maybe my final thought about that is um this idea of I want to use AI or technology to do my dishes and my dirty laundry so I can do my art and my PO poetry and my math in my particular case I heard it somewhere uh not the other way around right we don't want our AI to do our art our poetry our painting I don't wanted to do my math actually I want to do the the repetitive boring maybe even um the bad part of the things that we do at least that's my opinion and I do believe that it is possible thanks so much for sharing that Pedro Adam yeah this makes me think of uh so brace was just one of the many things we added to to canvas in the previous quarter and some of those things were were built using AI tools but they didn't have any AI in them so like an example of one of these tools was uh occasionally we'd have assignments where students write like a paragraph of text and but there's so many students that just sort of judging each paragraph of text for one second plus 10 seconds of overhead while canvas loads the next page uh one of the T made a tool to download everything from canvas put it into a spreadsheet and you could uh put in like okay assuming everyone's going to get a one I'll start dragging down the one across 10 students in a row so you could we're we're still getting full eyeball supervision we're still spending our you know three seconds per student but but we're spending no time waiting for canvas to load in the meantime so that was an example of like um uh I think grading is considered this like this status labor that people think isn't important enough to make tools like speed grader in canvas is not very Speedy especially in a large class but uh we're like uh I I don't want to make things autog graded because that will cut off this flow of of me understanding them and them understanding me but I do want the grading to be very efficient so we will use AI in making tools to make us into Super graders so that we don't go autog grading because I do want uh and we could in that same tool we had it so that you could sort of block grade 10 people at a time but anybody who needed a customized comment there was another spreadsheet field that would become a canvas comment so we still had the full Fidelity of feedback but more efficiency overall and I was involved in that I guess we could have made it without AI but that sort of it's now because it's easy to develop these tools that make gring more comfortable maybe we should just make we should make more tools to make gring more comfortable rather than making Auto graders and so on um and then there would be less multiple choice stuff and and more well that that was a a rant on on other things but uh yeah these labor issues especially in in engineering where many of my Tas can at some level automate their own job in in some of these autog grading Dimensions I don't want to say part of your ta duties is to make it so that we don't need to hire as many Tas in the future I want it so that oh part of your duties are to make tools so that you can be done with your ta job in four hours this week instead of 20 or something like that like I would love to to say it's it's that way they still get full credit and they get to practice and brag about this engineering contribution that they made and at some level they still did all their grading because they only did the the powerful human judgment part of it and not lots of button- clicking waiting stuff thank you so much Adam I'm going to um shift your topic a little bit and Aisha I'm going to start with you on this question and so in in thinking about your role as a as a leader in this institution what like how do you reflect on and think about your role in preparing students for future careers either doing academic work and higher education in industry and gaining more familiarity with generative AI or AI U while they're at UC Santa Cruz yeah I I um think about um my role in in the organization that I'm in as facilitators and so um providing the tools that are that would be leveraged by folks in on this panel um like Adam and Pedro to help facilitate the development of those literacies and so um I think about us is facilitating that providing the the the ecosystem that could be leveraged um by our students to to um do the development that you talked about I also think about it from the full Student Life side if we think about it more holistically and think about them outside of the classroom the ways in which um that learning can happen um in other areas outside of the classroom and looking at how we might support um for example um our advisors and or our Dess staff our division of student affairs and success staff and leveraging um platforms tools knowledge that we support um to help do the type of development that you described in our students Michael so I I consider us as facilitators I appreciate that thanks so much um Pedro or Adam is there anything that you'd like to add in terms of how you think about your role as an educator and preparing students for a world in which they'll be using AI uh one thing I can think of is that it feels like in my department of computational media like surely within a short number of years this will be something that we like cover in our intro class is just like one of the ways that you make interactive media but like there's no like useful books on it yet uh we're still inventing the the ways of doing it and I occasionally find myself like I showed that thing before of like get an idea for an interactive thing and like make it in the next eight seconds that feels like a skill that is super relevant to my students who want to make me F interactive media but I only learn how to do this trick recently so I I don't feel like I I can teach it to them um but I I do think it will be a thing that in the same way that people are saying oh well everyone should learn to code that that we should have prompting in Middle School uh so that you can have high school classes where students make interactive things really quickly uh like like Ben's history simulations that that shouldn't just be for history professors to do it should be for middle school students learning history to be able to make those simulations just like we expect everyone to learn how to make PowerPoint style presentations now not just graphic designers uh so it'll be pushed down the stack but none of us are experts yet thank you for adding that Adam P anything You' like to say um well I guess in that same vein it's pretty early um maybe the only thing I want to say is that it's going to be a challenge because he will make us question a lot of things even um I guess our students are facing this is like what does it mean to know something because now I can just chat GPT anything I want or what does it mean to write an essay what does it mean to solve a differential equation um I think that it's a challenge in that sense and it will force us to redefine certain things um and I'm curious to see where this leads us um but I do think also from the philosophical point of view as I tell my students I think that there's only one thing that is worse than ignorance and is the illusion of knowledge and I think that that's one of the biggest dangers in the teaching and learning part that we have is that illusion thank you so much Pedro for that I I really appreciate that so thinking about something worse than illusion um is to have uh excuse me to ignorance is that illusion of knowledge and how tools like chat gbt can influ influence us in ways that we have that sort of Illusion so I want to be um true to our time so as you can all see we've hardly started this really important conversation there are major topics including the environmental impact that AI is having on our climate um that we were not able to get to there's a lot more that we can talk about related to labor and uh use of these tools for um test like raing and I want to keep that conversation going and the next point at which we'll have the opportunity to discuss this on a large scale is through the TLC convocation which Robin mentioned is on April 24th of 2025 and that's going to be titled this year the high cost of Outsourcing thought on the ideology of artificial intelligence and we hope all of you will um continue the conversation at that point with us and a huge round of applause for these outstanding Educators and panelists who were willing to come and share their knowledge about how they're um really engaging in this new world of teaching with artificial intelligence thank you all so much and thank you all uh to those of you who gave up part of your night to join us and engage in the conversation
